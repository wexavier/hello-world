How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It showed the changes that we made that produced a bug,
    and it allowed us to easly go back to them and give a more in-depth look to fix the bug. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    By allowing access to old versions of the code you get to study the changes that were made
    and be able to go back in case of malfunctioning feature or a bug and fix it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    When you choose the commits manually you avoid creating unneccesary commits
    that might be created every hour for example as this type is not based on 
    any logical change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because sometimes all files work together to deliver the service this project
    is trying to deliver, so it makes sense to do so.
