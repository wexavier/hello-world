When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are working on a project with other people, and when you want to back up
	your project to the cloud so it's accessable from everywhere

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	because if I might not always want the latest changes made on the repository, for example if I was
	working on a feature and it was built on certain commits I wouldn't want to change these commits
	git might merge them or whatever

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	
	Forks are used to clone repositories on Github's server it basically copies the repository to your account
	and it mentions the source it was copied from

	Clones are copying from a repository to a local device

	Branches are a different rout in which commits can go
