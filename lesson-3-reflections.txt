When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you are working on a project with other people, and when you want to back up
	your project to the cloud so it's accessable from everywhere
	
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	I don't know yet
